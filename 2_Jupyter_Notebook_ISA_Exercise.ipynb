    "# Data Management Exercise using ISA Model and ISA API \n",
    "\n",
    "This exercise, in the form of a [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebook [1,2], is meant to identify key elements of experimental design from an actual study narrative and build a digital archive from them. This is achieved by structuring experimental metadata following a principled approach, driven by experimental design concepts, by relying on a Python application programming interface (API), the [ISA-API](http://github.com/isa-agents/isa-api) [3,4]. This ISA-API supports the [Investigation Study Assay Metadata model](http://isa-agents.org/) [5]. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Objectives\n",
    "- Recognize and identify the key experimental design descriptors.\n",
    "- Formalize the experimental design concepts using the ISA-API model. \n",
    "- Generate the study's metadata archive, corresponding to the experiment narrative, as an ISA format.\n",

    "   - Male Fisher F344 rats purchased from Charles River Laboratories were treated with either of *three chemical compounds* commonly used painkillers, namely (*aspirin, paracetamol and ibuprofen*), at *two distinct dose levels* (*low dose and high dose*), delivered per os. Observations were made at *three different time points* (*1 hour, 2 hours and 4 hours*).\n",
    "    \n",
    "   - Equal numbers of animals (n=5) were allocated to each of the possible study groups, defined by a unique *compound, dose level and time post exposure*  combination. Following sacrifice, performed by cervical dislocation preceded by anesthesia (ketamine and xylazine solution), *blood* and *liver* specimens (1 of each per animal) were collected.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - For liver samples, *total RNAs* was extracted; *transcription profiling* using *nucleotide sequencing* was performed *once* using a *paired-end library* approach on an *Illumina platform* using an *Illumina HiSeq 2000* as *sequencing instrument*.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - For blood samples, collected at sacrifice time and immediately placed in precooled 60 percent methanol ammonium bicarbonate buffer to extinguish cellular metabolism, *metabolites* were extracted in either *water-soluble fractions* or *lipophilic fractions*. *Metabolite profiling* using *mass spectrometry* was performed on the polar metabolite fraction only, using an *Agilent 6550 iFunnel Q-TOF* mass spectrometry instrument platform. Each fraction was introduced in the mass spectrometer by flow injection analysis (FIA) *twice* and data were acquired in both ionization modes (i.e. *positive*  and *negative*). Raw data files were saved in the native instrument format and later converted to [mzML](https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.26dmba), the HUPO-PSI standard format for mass spectrometry.\n"
